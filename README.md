there was a small bug where i wrote the layout component in the (root) as layour which wasn't working but we're good now.
I added the logic of the toggle button still not stylish yet.

### Finish with the NavBar

Finished with the logic and the style in the NavBar component and made it first check if the user signin or not and based on that the buttons will chage.

### Adjusting

I added the logo and remove the unnecessary so I can focus only for the next step which building the Hero page.

I finished with the SubHeading comonent and the resone why I put it in individual component cuz we'll need it in difference pages so to save time and not copy and past.
